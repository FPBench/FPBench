**Attach your benchmarks**

FPCore format is ideal, but we can convert from other languages for you in most cases.

**Context**

- Has the benchmark appeared in any research papers, books, or software?
- Do you have input ranges, preconditions, or example inputs?
- Can you describe the underlying mathematics being implemented
- What precision and math library was assumed by the code
