                                    Odometry 
Goal:   To compute the position of a robot depending on the speed of the wheels. 
Inputs: The most relevant input variables are the speed of the left and right wheels 'sl' and 'sr' in radian/second. 
Output: The most relevant outputs are 'x' and 'y' corresponding to the position of the robot. 
Ranges: Typycally, 0.05 < sl,sr < 2*Pi

                                    PID
Goal:   To keep the measure 'm' at the setpoint 'c' using the PID controller. 
Inputs: Measure 'm', the gains 'kp','ki', 'kd' and the setpoint 'c'. 
Outputs: the response 'r' and the new measure 'm'. 
Ranges:  Typically, -10.0 < m,c < 10.0

                                   Lead-Lag System
Goal:    Controller which tries to move the mass from an initial position 'y' to desired position 'yd'. 
Inputs:  yd, y
Outputs: xc0, xc1
Ranges:  0 < yd,y < 50, the coefficients Acii, Bci, Cci may be slightly modified.
