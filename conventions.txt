I'm going to here propose some conventions for writing FPBench
benchmarksm, beyond what the grammer specifies and what is strictly
necessary for correctness.

1. Specify the name of a test, if present, first.

2. Specify information about the source and domain of the benchmark
before information about the program (e.g. citation before
precondition).

3. Don't shadow parameters with loop variables.

4. Use square brackets for all variable binding constructs.
