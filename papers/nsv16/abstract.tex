%The community needs benchmarks for floating point tools.

In this article, we propose a standard benchmark for the validation and optimization of the numerical accuracy of floating-point computations to facilitate the comparison of the tools developed in this domain. 
This benchmarks responds to an increasing need of the community, to compare different tools, associated to various domains of application.  
More specifically, we consider a standard floating-point benchmark format and we propose then several measures.
These measures make it possible to compare tools for the verification and improvement of the numerical accuracy of programs. 
In this way, we provide a set of experimentations applied on various examples to show the useful of our suite.
