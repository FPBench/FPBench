\section{Benchmarks}
\label{sec:benchmarks}

The \name suite includes \nbenches benchmarks
  sourced from recent papers in floating point verification,
  optimization, and accuracy improvement.
Of the benchmarks,
  28 are drawn from the Herbie test suite~\cite{pavel15},
  9 from a series of papers by Martel et~al.~\cite{fmics15},
  7 from the test suite for Rosa~\cite{DarulovaK14},
  and one from the FPTaylor test suite~\cite{fptaylor-fm15}.
Together, these programs come from
  a variety of domains and applications,
  from control software to mathematical libraries.
The included benchmarks use the range of functionality
  available in \name:

\begin{tabular}{lr}
Name & Benchmarks \\\hline
Basic Arithmetic & 44 \\
Exponentials & 13 \\
Trigonometric & 10 \\
Comparison & 12 \\
Conditionals & 3 \\
Loops & 12
\end{tabular}
