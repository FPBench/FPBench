\section{Conlusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The initial work on \name presented in this article provides a basic
foundation for evaluating and comparing floating-point analysis and
optimization tools.  Already the \name format can serve as a
\textit{lingua franca} between such tools and enable them to
cooperatively analyze and improve floating-point code.

Of course, there is still much work to do in order to make \name
sufficiently expressive for the broad range of applications
represented in the floating-point community.  In the near term, we
will add additional metrics for accuracy and performance to the set of
evaluators provided by the \name tooling and begin developing a
standard set of benchmarks around the various measures.  We will also
expand the set of languages with direct support for compilation to and
from the \name format, by expanding the \surface format and
potentially adding new surface syntaxes for \name. Longer term, we
intend to investigate support for mixed-precision benchmark, including
supporting fixed-point computations.

We hope that \name can help foster the already strong sense of
community and collaboration around floating-point research.  Toward
that end, we encourage any interested readers (and tool writers) to
get involved with development of \name by signing up for the mailing
list and checking out the project website at
\url{http://fpbench.org/}.
