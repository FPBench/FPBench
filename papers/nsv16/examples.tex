FPBench supports benchmarks from a variety of domains, with a variety
of characteristics. Here, we'll highlight a few representative
examples supported by FPBench, and describe their characteristics
briefly.

\subsection{Quadratic Formula}

The quadratic formula is a common formula used to compute the roots of
a degree two polynomial. It appears in \textit{Numerical Methods for
  Scientists and Engineers}, by Richard Hamming, in a section on
rearranging computations for numerical accuracy. It has uses in a
variety of applications, from calculating trajectories, to solving
matrix equations. In mathematical notation, the quadratic formula is
written as:
