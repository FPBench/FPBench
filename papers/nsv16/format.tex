\section{Benchmark Format}
\label{sec:format}

\name provides a common input format for floating-point tools.
This format makes it possible to develop
  a collection of floating-point benchmarks
  common to our research community,
  and also allows users to compose floating-point tools.
So, a common floating-point benchmark format must be
  easy to parse,
  have simple and clear semantics,
  support floating-point details, and
  provide sufficient expressiveness for diverse application domains.
To satisfy these requirements,
  \name provides the \core format,
  a minimal expression-based language
  for floating-point computations
  with features for iteration, input ranges,
  error measures, target accuracy, and floating-point
  precision.
A common floating-point benchmark format
  must also be easy to translate to and from
  popular industrial languages like C, C++, Matlab, and Fortran.
To satisfy these requirements,
  \name also provides the extended \surface format,
  a basic imperative language for floating-point computations
  which can be automatically compiled to \core.

\subsection{\core}

\core is an S-expression format featuring
  mathematical functions, \C{if} statements, and \C{while} loops.
All floating-point functions
  from C11's \C{math.h} and all Fortran 2003 intrinsics
  are supported operators,
  as well as standard arithmetic operators like addition and comparison;
  likewise, all constants defined in C11's \C{math.h} are available as constants.
Following IEEE754 and common C and Fortran runtimes,
  \core does not prescribe the accuracy of built-in
  mathematical functions.
However, individual benchmarks can declare the accuracy
  they assume for built-in operations which
  analyzers can take into account.

%%   neither does \core specify the values of these functions.
%% We expect that most libraries implement these functions
%%   to within a few ulps of accuracy;
%%   for example, on most architectures
%%   the GNU \C{libm} gives accurate answers across most of the input range.

A \core benchmark specifies a set of inputs,
  a floating-point expression,
  and meta-data flags including
  a name, citations, preconditions on inputs,
  and the floating-point precision
  (\C{binary32}, \C{binary64}, \ldots)
  used to evaluate that benchmark.
The full \core syntax is as follows:~\footnote{
Not shown in the grammar:
  \name uses ``\C{;}'' the indicate that
  the remainder of a line is a comment.}

\begin{grammar}
\small
<\core> ::= ( `\core' ( <identifier>* ) <property>* <expression> )

<expression> ::= <constant> | <identifier> | ( <operation> <expression>* )
\alt ( `if' <expression> <expression> <expression> )
\alt ( `while' <expression> ( <loopvar>* ) <expression> )
\alt ( `let' ( <binding>* ) <expression> )

<loopvar> ::= [ <identifier> <expression> <expression> ]

<constant> ::= <number> | `E' | `LOG2E' | `LOG10E' | `LN2' | `LN10' | `PI' | $\dotsb$

<operation> ::= `+' | `*' | `<' | $\dotsb$ | `abs' | `acos' | `and' | `asin' | $\dotsb$

<property> ::= <propname> <propval>

<propname> ::= `:name' | `:cite' | `:pre' | `:type' | $\dotsb$

<propval> ::= <expression> | <string> | ( <identifier>* ) | <identifier>

<binding> ::= [ <identifier> <expression> ]
\end{grammar}

Since the language is S-expression based,
  parentheses and braces are literals.
The semantics of these programs is ordinary function evaluation,
  with \C{let} bindings evaluated simultaneously
  and \C{while} loops evaluated
  by simultaneously updating the loop variables
  until the condition is true,
  and then evaluating the return value:

\begin{mathpar}
\small
\inferrule{
  H : x_i^0 \evalto v_i \\
  H[x_i \mapsto v_i]_i: c \evalto \top \\
  H[x_i \mapsto v_i]_i: e_i \evalto x_i' \\
  H: (\C{while}\quad c\quad ([x_i\quad x_i'\quad e_i]_i)\quad y) \evalto v
}{
  H: (\C{while}\quad c\quad ([x_i\quad x_i^0\quad e_i]_i)\quad y) \evalto v
}

\inferrule{
  H : x_i^0 \evalto v_i \\
  H[x_i \mapsto v_i]_i : c \evalto \bot \\
  H[x_i \mapsto v_i]_i : y \evalto v
}{
  H: (\C{while}\quad c\quad ([x_i\quad x_i^0\quad e_i]_i)\quad y) \evalto v
}
\end{mathpar}

The list of properties is used to record additional information
  about each benchmark.
Existing benchmarks are annotated with a \C{:name},
  a \C{:description} of the benchmark and its inputs,
  the floating-point \C{:type} (either \C{binary32} or \C{binary64}),
  a precondition \C{:pre}, and a citation \C{:cite}.
All \name tools ignore unknown attributes,
  so they represent an easy way to record additional benchmark information.
We recommend that properties specific to a single tool
  be prefixed with the name of the tool.

\subsection{\surface}

Where \core is the format consumed by tools,
  \surface is a format for simplifying the translation
  from imperative languages to \core.
While \core is a functional language
  with a minimal set of features
  for representing floating-point computations,
  \surface includes common imperative features
  like variable assignments,
  multiple return values,
  and multi-way \C{if} statements.
More complex features,
  such as arrays, pointers, records, and recursive function calls,
  are left to future language extensions.
In our experience,
  translating C, Fortran, and Matlab to \surface is relatively easy.
\surface has expressions similar to those in \core,
  but without \C{if}, \C{while}, and \C{let} expressions;
  these are instead replaced with statements.
The \surface syntax is as follows:

\begin{grammar}
<\surface> ::= ( `\surface' ( <identifier>* ) <property>* <statement>* <output> )

<output> ::= ( `output' <expression>* )

<expression> ::= <constant> | <identifier> | ( <operation> <expression>* )

<statement> ::= [ `=' <identifier> <expression> ]
\alt ( `if' <ifbranch>* )
\alt ( `while' <expression> <statement>* )

<ifbranch> ::= [ <expression> <statement>* ]
\alt [ `else' <statement>* ]
\end{grammar}

As in \core, each \surface benchmark
  includes free parameters and properties;
  as an imperative language,
  it includes a list of program statements
  and multiple return values
  instead of a single body expression.
Assignments and while loops behave in the usual way.
Expressions in \surface are evaluated similarly to \core expressions.
An \C{if} statement defines a many-way branch;
  any \C{else} branch must be the last branch in its \C{if}.
The \C{output} statement can return several values and appears
  at the end of a function.

The \surface to \core compiler
  translates \surface functions to \core benchmarks
  while retaining all properties and keeping the same set of free parameters.
It inlines assignments, converts the imperative bodies of \surface loops
  to the simultaneous-assignment loops of \core,
  replaces many-way \C{if} statements with nested \C{if}s,
  and outputs multiple \core benchmarks for \surface programs with
  multiple outputs.
